Instructions and help for using the eLife Ambassadors GitHub organisation

## Why use GitHub for eLife Ambassadors projects?

GitHub is a useful tool to share your public outputs within a framework that is designed for online collaboration – this is particularly suitable for any projects which will continue beyond the eLife Ambassadors programme cohort(s).

GitHub is designed for open source software and code and is also often used for non-code outputs – it is a really powerful project management tool once you’ve got started with it. With GitHub, you can easily make a free basic website for your project, and include fun things like emojis and GIFs in your homepage. 

Here are some examples:
* A Women in Science initiative https://github.com/malvikasharan/EMBL-Women-2019
* A  web-based handbook https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way 
* An R package https://github.com/weecology/portalr 

## About the eLifeAmbassadors GitHub organisation

The eLife Ambassadors have a non-profit account on GitHub, which means we can host a repository for you within this eLifeAmbassadors organisation (homepage: https://github.com/eLifeAmbassadors) and you can maintain public and private repositories for free.

Keeping your project in this organisation will help your work be discoverable to others – we'll need only to point people to this GitHub and they'll see all your projects in one place.
